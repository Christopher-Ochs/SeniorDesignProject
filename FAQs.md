# FAQs

#### How are stock trends predicted?

- Stock trends are predicted using a [neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) which generates a mathematical model. The network will exam the current stock and its past trends in relation to the rest of the market and give its best prediction for whether the stock will rise or fall. 
- The prediction from the model will be more accurate for immediate trends rather than a long term investment.

#### Can I add my own tweaks to the model?

- Yes the way in which the model values certain parameters can be tweaked by users with the premium developer subscription. This feature is currently in development and will be updated with documentation when it becomes available.
