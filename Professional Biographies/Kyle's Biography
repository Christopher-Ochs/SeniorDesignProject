### Project Sought:

 I am looking for a project with potential to have real world impact. I am intersted in building software for a good  
 purpose.Also interested in machine learning and data analytics. Not necessarily narrowing down my project idea to a  
 webapp or solely a machine learning model - but want to do something along the lines. As long as I'm coding - I'm   
 okay with a larger scope of different project types.
