### Project Sought

I am looking for a project which I will find challenging and reaches into areas of technology that I am interested and have theoretical knowledge surrounding but don't have much experience.

These areas of interest include

- progressive web apps
- building machine learning models and incorporating them into a machine learning pipeline

I am okay with a large variety of projects as long as they fall into one or more of the above categories
