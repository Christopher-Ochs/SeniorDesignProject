## Project Description
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict trends in the stock market.
This will be a multi-faceted project where we will be procuring our own data,
building our own model, and establishing our own visualization of the model's results.

## Project Problem Statement
With all of the information out there, there should be a way to properly track trends
in the stock market. If this were a possibility, it may be possible to forsee crashes in
the market or opportune times to increase/decrease investments.

## Inadequacy of Current Solutions to Problem
The current models that are out there are not accurate enough, overfit the data, or can not reliably
predict trends in the stock market.

## Background Skills/Applicable Interests
Our interests reside in machine learning and hybrid models that can be used in novel capacities. With the combined interests 
and skills that our group possesses, we should be able to produce a quality product that all of us woud benefit from using. 

## Project Team Approach
This project will include 4 major steps to complete:
1) Develop a web scraper for data acquisition
2) Design a model for cleaning the data we collect
3) Create a hybrid ANN or CNN to predict stock trends
4) Implement a visualization platform for the data and model results

Once the project is deemed finished, it should be able to reliably predict stock market trends so that end users can make wiser 
decisions on how and where to invest their money.
