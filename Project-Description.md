# Project Description:
We want to build a machine learning model to predict trends in the stock market.
This will be a multi-faceted project where we will be procuring our own data,
building our own model, and establishing our own visualization of the model's results.

# Project Problem Statement:
With all of the information out there, there should be a way to properly track trends
in the stock market. If this were a possibility, it may be possible to forsee crash's in
the market.

# Inadequacy of Current Solutions to Problem:
The current models that are out there are not accurate enough, overfit the data, or can not
predict trends at all.

# Background Skills/Interests Applicable
Our interests reside in machine learning and hybrid models that can be used in novel capacities.

# Project Team Approach:
1) Web Scraper for data acquisition
2) A model for cleaning the data we collect
3) Hybrid ANN or CNN to predict stock trends
4) Visualization platform for the data and model results
