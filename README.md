Advisor: Yizong Cheng

Team Members: Matthew Krauskopf, Christopher Ochs, Kyle O'Connor, Philip Tallo

## Abstract

To allow users to have better control over their finances, we will provide a web-based multifaceted application. The application will allow for end users to examine specific publicly traded stocks and get a prediction, with a specific degree of certainty, on whether to buy or sell a particular stock. This functionality will allow for users to manage their finances comfortably.
