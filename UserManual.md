2) If the user doesn't have an account then the user should click **sign up**. Then the user will be redirected to the login page below which will prompt them to enter information so they can create an account.

3) After filling in the form in the above step the user will be have an receive a confirmation e-mail. This step must be completed before the user will be able to use the platform

4) If the user has an account or has completed steps 1 to 3 above already then they are ready to login and should return to <domain name here> and click the **login** button this time, where they will be prompted to enter their account information before they can continue to the platform.

## **Platform Use**

The main user platform is where the user will be able to look at current/past stock prices for a particular stock and also be able to visualize that data.

The user will also be able to take advantage of the machine learning model that is a part of the platform to predict stocks they are interested in.

Another feature we would like to include is a way for users to manipulate the parameters of our model and/or upload their own models to the platform.

### Data Visualization

#### Current Price

The user can search a stock by it's ticker name.

In the search bar type in the ticker name and select that stock to be visualized

The visualization will contain the current stock price and the stock price for the past day in graph form.

The user will be able to change date range for the stock for example, the user can change the date to look at the stock during a particular time or from 3 years ago to the present time.

Along with the visualization of on stock on a larger graph there will also be a sidebar that will house smaller graphs for the visualization of many different stocks in the users "favorites". 

	- The user can easily add stocks to their favorites by searching for the ticker and clicking the plus sign at the top of the stock to add to favorites.
	- This will move the stock to the favorites bar where the user will be able to view it while navigating the platform.

#### **Predicted Price**

On the visualization side the user will also be able to view the predicted trend of a stock or many stocks at the same time through their favorites bar.

The user will see what the predicted price is, the confidence of that price in their future time-range, and a "brokers" view of what to do with that stock.

The confidence will be shown to the user and the Broker-bot will tell the user to: buy, sell, or hold with a certain confidence on each.

### **The Model**

The model is the machine learning side of this platform.

The architecture is a neural network - kind of how the brain works but only for specific data.

The confidence given by the neural network is only as powerful as the data that is behind the model.

### Developer Mode

Users can pay a premium to use our developer mode.

In developer mode users will be able to tweak the current model and use our API to build their own models.

Once the feature is built user docs, tutorials, and other knowledgebase items will be added for users to be able to fully utilize this facet of our platform.
